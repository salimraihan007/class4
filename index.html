    	<p><b>In December, 2021.....Lucy, our great family baker, transformed from an ordinary housewife to a great baker. She had big dreams, little means but full of boundless determination to succeed. Lucy opened the first bakery in Banani which soon became a neighborhood staple, well known for delicious baked goods and a family first experience. She grew the business - and its reputation - throughout the Banani area. Now, for last three years, we continue to rely on old world recipes that have defined our family and business for years, making things from scratch, focusing first and foremost on craft and quality.From our family to yours, thank you for visiting our website and we hope you visit our bakery to enjoy our treats!</b></p>
